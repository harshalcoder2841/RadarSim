"""
Tracking Module

Multi-target tracking system for radar simulation.

Components:
    - LinearKalmanFilter: Constant Velocity Kalman Filter
    - TrackManager: Multi-target track management with data association
    - Track: Individual target track container
    - TrackStatus: Track lifecycle states

Example:
    >>> from src.tracking import TrackManager
    >>> manager = TrackManager(gate_distance=500)
    >>> tracks = manager.update([(1000, 2000), (3000, 4000)], dt=0.1)
